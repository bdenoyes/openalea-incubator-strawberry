## Compute mean individual and plot

Rscripts
	- 2017_04_27_selection of the most central individual.R, this selection was perform on the extraction of sequence according module non overlapping. 
	[Hint: Selection of the most central individual no generalize i don't know if this funtion is extendible]
	- Architecture sequence analysis-scriptpropre.R. This script allows to represent the number of flower, leaves,ect by order and realize linear regression in order to identify from which order we obtain a stationarity of the number of flowers, leave ect. 
	[Hint: Error, Figure representing linear model with confident interval script need to clear the script and review some function]   
	
## Visualisation 2D, 3D for each genotypes, ...

* 2D: create a module
* 3D : test on previous and new MTGs
